CHANGELOG!

+ Base Version

v1.1

* Fixed texture consistancy throughout the map.
+ Added shadow clippings generating shadows and other lighting effects.
+ Added radar dots for the hostages and the rescue zone.
- Removed a bug where players could enter the skybox through the Maze Easter Egg
+ Added teleport triggers to the maze to prevent the skybox exploits from occuring (thanks notawaller!)
+ Added cover to mid for Ts to hide in.
* Changed the timings from CT mid, allowing more than one player at a time to access mid quicker, and help them win fights.
ABOUT!

This is the original de_waterworld, a hostage variant. The defusal mode takes off the design and a lot of the buildings are changed, with different clippings.
